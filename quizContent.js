/* CODING CHALLENGE - QUIZ */
/*
--- Let's build a fun browser based quiz game

1. Build a function that accepts a QUESTIONS array and a score parameter.

2. The QUESTIONS array should include questions and each question should include
a) a question
b) the possible answers for the question (we're going for a multiple choice)
c) a way to store the correct answer

3. When this function is invoked, it will prompt the user with a random question
and with the possible answers.

4. Alert the user if their answer is correct and then prompt them a new question

4. The user should get their score after each answer (either correct or
incorrect).

5. Since we don't want the game to never end, include an option to quit the
game if the user answers 'exit'.
